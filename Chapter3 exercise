Suppose x=3 and y=2; show the output if any of the following code. 
What is the output if x=3 and y=4? 
What is the output if x=2 and y=2?
Draw a flowchart of code.
     if (x>2) {
       if (y>2) {
           int z=x+y;
           cout<<"z is "<<z<<sndl;
        }
      }
else
         cout << "x is" << x << endl;

For x=3 and y=2:The condition x>2 is satisfied, 
but y<=2 so the else statement will not run. 
The code will move to the inner if statement, but y<=2 so it will also not run. 
Therefore, there will be no output.
For x=3 and y=4:Both conditions x>2 and y>2 are satisfied. 
Therefore, the inner if statement will run and z will be assigned the value 7. 
The output will be "z is 7".
For x=2 and y=2:The condition x>2 is not satisfied so the code will move to the else statement. 
x will be outputted as "x is 2".
Flowchart of the code:     
   +----(x>2)----+       |     
        |       |             |       | 
      +----(y>2)----+       |       |       
      |       |       |             |       |  
     |      int z=x+y;   //z = 5 or 6 or 7 or ...    
   |       |      cout<<"z is "<<z<<sndl; 
  //output z       |       |         
    |       |       +-------------+       |           
          |       |                     |       |       
              |       |       +--------+       |       |    
    |       |       |    
    |       +----(else)------+ cout << "x is" << x << endl; 
  //output x Note: Each if and else statement contains one statement, so there is no need for curly braces. 
However, it is still better to use curly braces as it makes the code more readable and easier to modify.

Write a program to accept any character from keyboard and display whether it is vowel or not


`
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    char ch;

    std::cout << "Enter a character: ";
    std::cin >> ch;

    switch(ch) {
        case 'a':
        case 'e':
        case 'i':
        case 'o':
        case 'u':
        case 'A':
        case 'E':
        case 'I':
        case 'O':
        case 'U':
            std::cout << ch << " is a vowel." << std::endl;
            break;
        default:
            std::cout << ch << " is not a vowel." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}






Write a program that gives grade based on the following scale using if else statement:



 Score      Grade
90-100     A
80-89      B
70-79      C
60-69      D
Below 60   F


score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("Your grade is A")
elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
    print("Your grade is B")
elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
    print("Your grade is C")
elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
    print("Your grade is D")
else:
    print("Your grade is F")


In this program, we first take the user input for the score. Then we use if-elif-else statements to check the score range and print the corresponding grade. If the score is between 90 and 100, we print "A", if it's between 80 and 89, we print "B", and so on. If the score is below 60, we print "F".




Write a program that display greatest of three numbers using if statement accept input from user



#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3;

    std::cout << "Enter three numbers: ";
    std::cin >> num1 >> num2 >> num3;

    if (num1 >= num2 && num1 >= num3) {
        std::cout << "The greatest number is " << num1 << std::endl;
    } else if (num2 >= num1 && num2 >= num3) {
        std::cout << "The greatest number is " << num2 << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The greatest number is " << num3 << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}



Write a program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints increasing if the numbers are in increasing order , decreasing if the numbers are in decreasing order   and neither increasing nor decreasing order otherwise.




num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if num1 < num2 < num3:
    print("Increasing")
elif num1 > num2 > num3:
    print("Decreasing")
else:
    print("Neither increasing nor decreasing")


In this program, we first take the user input for three numbers. Then we use if-elif-else statements to check if the numbers are in increasing order, decreasing order, or neither. If num1 is less than num2 and num2 is less than num3, we print "Increasing". If num1 is greater than num2 and num2 is greater than num3, we print "Decreasing". Otherwise, we print "Neither increasing nor decreasing".




Write a program to calculate sum, average and check you grade status , if pass or fail.
Hint;accept at least thee course marks then calculate the total and average of your mark the status will be based on average value. Display the total mark average and status



marks = 
totalmarks = 0
numofcourses = int(input("Enter the number of courses: "))

for i in range(numofcourses):
    mark = float(input(f"Enter mark for course {i+1}: "))
    marks.append(mark)
    totalmarks += mark

average = totalmarks / numofcourses

print(f"Total Marks: {totalmarks}")
print(f"Average Mark: {average}")

if average >= 50:
    print("You have passed!")
else:
    print("You have failed.")




Quiz 2




Write a program that calculates sum of numbers from 1 to 100.


# Method 1: Using a loop
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    sum += i
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is {sum}")

# Method 2: Using the formula for sum of first n natural numbers
n = 100
sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is {sum}")




Write a program that displays numbers between 0-100 that are divisible by 2,3, and 5. 
The numbers displayed should be those that can be divided by 2,3, and 5 without remainder.





for num in range(101):   
 if num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:       
 print(num) This program uses a  for  loop to iterate through the numbers from 0 to 100. 
For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5 without remainder using the modulo operator  % . 
If the number satisfies all three conditions, it is printed to the console.



Write a program that calculates factorial using for loop, while loop and do while loops. The program should accept the number and then perform the calculation of the factorial.


public class FactorialCalculator {    public static void main(String[] args) {        int number, i = 1, fact = 1;                // Get input from user        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);        System.out.print("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ");        number = sc.nextInt();                // Calculate factorial using for loop        for(i = 1; i <= number; i++){            fact = fact * i;        }        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " using for loop: " + fact);        
        // Calculate factorial using while loop    
    i = 1;        fact = 1;        while(i <= number){            
fact = fact * i;            i++;        }        
System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " using while loop: " + fact);         
       // Calculate factorial using do-while loop        i = 1;        fact = 1;      
  do{            fact = fact * i;        
    i++;        }while(i <= number);      
  System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " using do-while loop: " + fact);    }}
 When you run this program, it will prompt the user to enter a number to calculate its factorial, and then it will calculate and display the factorial using each of the three loop types.



Write a while loop that prints the average of numbers from 1 to 10.


nums = range(1, 11)sum = 0count = 0while count < len(nums):    
sum += nums[count]    
count += 1average = sum / len(nums)print(average) 
Note that in python 3  range  returns an iterator, so you can use  for  loop to iterate over the values of the range without creating a list. 
pythonnums = range(1, 11)sum = 0count = 0for num in nums:  
  sum += num    count += 1average = sum / countprint(average) You could also use the python built-in function  sum  and  len  to calculate the average pythonnums = range(1, 11)average = sum(nums)/len(nums)print(average)
